#Use the super() Function
#Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
class Person:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname):
        self.firstname = fname
        self.lastname = lname

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
        super().__init__(fname, lname)
        self.graduationyear = year

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)
